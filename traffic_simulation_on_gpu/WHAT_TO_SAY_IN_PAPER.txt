1: Traffic Simulation is not narually parallelable.
2: Upper Stream - Down Stream Depdence & Partitions.
3: Optimistic and Premistic Protocal
4: Empty_Space_Prediction_Protocal
4:1: Time Step divided into 2 phases: Pre-Corss Phase and Corss Phase
4:2: Queue Length Prediction (Queue(t) = Queue(t-1) + (Queue(t-1) - Queue(t-2))
5: Empty_Space_Prediction_Protocal greatly improve the massive parallelability of traffic simulation
